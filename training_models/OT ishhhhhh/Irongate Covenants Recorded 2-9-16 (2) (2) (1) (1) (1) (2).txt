ARTICLE 4-COVENANTS CONCERNING ASSES MENTS AND LIENS 
Section 4.01. General Assessments. For the purpose of providing funds for the operation of the 
Association, for the purposes described in Section 4.12 below and for the operation, maintenance, 
care and improvement of the Common Area, and to afford the Association (and Declarant, during 
such time as it is performing the duties and powers of the Association pursuant to Section 8.01 B. 
hereof) the means and resources necessary to carry out its duties and functions, the Association shall 
have the right, in each year, to assess, except as specifically provided in this Article, against each 
Lot a general assessment, which general assessment shall subject each Lot to a lien to secure 
payment thereof. The general assessment may be paid annually, semiannually, quarterly or monthly, 
as specified by the Board ( or the Declarant in lieu thereof), from time to time. The amount of the 
initial general assessment shall be established by Declarant and shall commence on the date 
specified by Declarant upon notice given to the Owners. In the event a Lot is initially transferred by 
Declarant other than the I" day of a calendar year, the assessment for such initial calendar year shall 
be prorated. The Board (or Declarant) will notify all Owners stating the amount of the assessment 
and when payment is due; provided, in no event shall payment be due sooner than thirty (30) days 
following the notice of such assessment is mailed by the Board or Declarant. The obligation of any 
Owner to pay such assessments shall commence upon the purchase of a Lot (or such later date as 
may be designated by Declarant) and is not dependent upon there being improvements erected 
thereon. Suspension of the right to use the Common Area or voluntary non-use thereof shall not 
12 
relieve any Owner of any obligation to pay assessments. Neither shall any Owner have any right to 
withhold payment of assessments hereunder by virtue of the nonpayment thereof by any other 
Owner or the violation of these covenants, conditions and restrictions or any rule or regulation 
promulgated by the Declarant or the Board. 
Section 4.02. Determination of General Assessments. Each year the Board or the Declarant on behalf 
of the Board shall, prior to January 1 (or as soon thereafter as practicable), determine the total 
amount to be raised by the general assessment charges for the next succeeding year. Subject to any 
exemptions permitted by this Declaration, each Lot shall be assessed an equal amount for general 
assessments. Should the Board at any time determine, in its sole discretion, that the assessments 
levied are or may prove to be insufficient to pay the costs of operation and management of the 
Association, or in the event of emergencies, the Board shall have the authority to levy such 
additional assessment or assessments as it shall deem necessary. 
Section 4.03. Basis of Assessment; Exemptions; Transfer Assessment; Proration. 
A. All general assessments shall be made against the Owners on an equal basis for each Lot, or 
fraction thereof owned by the Owner or Owners, except that in view of the substantial 
expenditures incurred by Declarant in connection with the Common Area, Declarant, and any 
properly licensed general contractor owning a Lot for the purpose of constructing a residence 
thereon and offering the same for sale, shall be exempt from imposition of any assessment, 
whether general or special, with respect to any Lot so long as Declarant or such contractor 
holds legal title thereto (provided, the assessment exemption for such general contractors 
shall not extend beyond twelve (12) months from the date an applicable Lot is conveyed to 
such contractor and shall cease if the Lot and residence thereon is occupied for residential 
purposes). 
B. In the event any Lot would be subject to a general or special assessment in any calendar year, 
if it were not for an exemption available under subsection A immediately above, at such time 
as such exemption is no longer in effect during such calendar year, the applicable assessment 
shall be prorated for such year (based on the remaining portion of such year) and be paid by 
the then Owner at the time he acquires the Lot. 
C. At any time, legal title to a Lot transfers, the transferee shall pay at the time of the closing of 
such transfer to the working capital of the Association an amount equal to Two Hundred 
Dollars ($200.00); provided the requirement to pay such a fee shall not apply to either: 
a. the transfer by Declarant to an affiliated entity, or the transfer ofDeclarant's interest 
as developer of the Property; 
b. the transfer of title to any Lot to a properly licensed general contractor for purposes 
of constructing a residence thereon for the purpose of offering the same for sale; or 
c. any transfer by an Owner to such Owner's trust; a transfer due to the marriage or 
divorce of an Owner; or for other reasons which are determined by the Declarant or 
the Board to be of such a nature so that the payment of a transfer fee is inappropriate. 
13 
Section 4.04. Special Assessments. 
A. In addition to general assessments, the Board (or the Declarant under Section 8.01 B. hereof) 
may, from time to time, at a regular meeting or a special meeting called upon notice for such 
purpose, establish a special assessment to be levied equally against each Lot (subject to the 
exemptions contained in Section 4.03 A above) for the purpose of providing additional funds 
(not sufficiently available through general assessments) to carry out its duties and other 
functions and purposes contemplated hereunder and to make improvements or expenditures. 
No such special assessment to all Lots under this subsection A shall be valid unless two­ 
thirds (2/3) of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at an annual or special meeting of the 
Members. Any special assessments shall become a lien against each individual Lot (subject 
to the exemption specified in Section 4.03 A above) in the same manner otherwise provided 
for in this Article. 
B. The Board, on behalf of the Association, shall have the authority to establish and fix a special 
assessment on any Lot to secure the liability of the Owner to the Association for any breach 
by such Owner of any of the provisions of this Declaration, which breach shall result in an 
expenditure by the Association for repair or remedy. Any special assessments shall be 
payable in full (unless a schedule for payment in installments is specified) on the first day of 
the second calendar month next following the date that the same shall be established by the 
Board. 
Section 4.05. Collection and Expenditures. The Board (or the Declarant, so long as it is carrying out 
the duties and powers of the Association) shall have the sole authority to collect and enforce the 
collection of all general and special assessments provided for in this Declaration, and may, in 
addition to such assessments, charge and assess costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and 
penalties and interest for the late payment or nonpayment thereof. The Board shall have tbe 
authority to expend all monies collected from such assessments, costs, penalties and interest for the 
payment of expenses and costs in carrying out the duties, rights and powers of the Association as 
provided for in this Declaration and the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Association. 
However, the Association shall not be obligated to spend in any year all the sums collected in such 
year by way of assessments, or otherwise, and may carry forward, as surplus or in reserves, any 
balances remaining; nor shall the Association be obligated to apply any such surpluses or reserves to 
the reduction of the amount of the assessments in the succeeding year, but may carry forward from 
year to year such surplus as the Board, in its absolute discretion, may determine to be desirable for 
the greater financial security of the Association and the effectuation of its purposes. 
Section 4.06. Assessments and Liens Delinquency. Thirty (30) days after any general or special 
assessment shall be due and payable, and remains unpaid or otherwise not satisfied, the same shall 
be and become delinquent and automatically become a lien on the Lot and shall so continue until the 
amount of said charge and assessment, together with all costs, penalties and interest as herein 
provided, has been fully paid or otherwise satisfied. 
Section 4.07. Notice of Delinquency. At any time after any general or special assessment against any 
Lot has become a lien and delinquent, the Declarant or an officer of the Association may record in 
the office of the Register of Deeds, Sedgwick County, Kansas, a Notice of Delinquency as to such 
Lot, which notice shall state therein the amount of such delinquency and that it is a lien, and the 
interest, costs (including attorneys' fees) and penalties which have accrued thereon, a description of 
14 
the Lot against which the same has been assessed, and the name of the Owner thereof, and such 
notice shall be signed by an officer of the Association. Upon payment or other satisfaction of said 
assessment, interest, penalties and costs in connection with which notice has been recorded, the 
Association shall record a further notice stating the satisfaction and the release of the lien thereof. 
Section 4.08. Enforcement of Liens. Each lien established pursuant to the provisions ofthis 
Declaration and which is specified in a Notice of Delinquency as hereinabove provided, may be 
foreclosed in like manner as a mortgage on real property as provided by the laws of Kansas at any 
time within twenty (20) years following the recording of a Notice of Delinquency. In any action to 
foreclose any such lien, the Association shall be entitled to recover its costs, including reasonable 
attorneys' fees, and such penalties for delinquent charges and assessments as shall have been 
established by the Board. In connection with any liens created pursuant to this Declaration or 
documentation associated therewith (whether such liens are now in existence or are created at any 
time in the future), each Owner to the extent permitted by law, hereby waives the benefit of any 
redemption, homestead or exemption laws of the State of Kansas now in effect, or in effect from 
time to time hereafter. 
Section 4.09. Subordination of Assessment Lien. Eacb and every assessment and lien, together with 
any costs, penalties and interest reserved under this Declaration, shall be subordinate to the lien of 
any valid bona fide first mortgage which has been, or may hereafter be, given in good faith and for 
value by any bank, savings and loan or other institution in the business of regularly conducting 
residential lending on any interest of any Owner covered by this Declaration. Any unpaid 
assessments shall be deemed to be common expenses collectible from assessments made to all Lots. 
Nothing contained herein shall release a person or entity from his or its personal liability for any 
assessments assessed while such person or entity owns a Lot which becomes delinquent prior to any 
such foreclosure. 
Section 4.10. Personal Liability. In addition to the covenants and agreements heretofore set forth 
herein, each Owner, by the acceptance of title to such owner's Lot, whether or not it shall be so 
expressed in such deed, shall be deemed to have agreed to be personally liable for the payment of 
each general or special assessment levied against such Lot during the period of ownership (subject to 
the exemptions specified in Section 4.03 A above). 
Section 4.11. Interest on Delinquent Assessments. All assessment charges (general or special) which 
remain due and unpaid thirty (30) days after the same are due shall thereafter be subject to interest at 
the rate of eighteen percent (18%) per annum, or such other rate as may be established from time to 
time by the Board; provided, however, that such interest rate shall never exceed the maximum 
allowed by law. 
Section 4.12. Use of General Assessment Funds. The Association's general assessment fund, shall be 
used for such of the following purposes as the Board or the Declarant on behalf of the Board shall 
determine necessary and advisable: for the use, benefit and enjoyment of the Owners, including 
improving, maintainin g, repairing and replacing the Common Area and improvements thereon

limited to, expenses incurred in connection with the proper operation, maintenance and repair of any 
improvements located within the Common Area; collecting and disposing of garbage and rubbish

ARTICLE 5 - COVENANTS FOR MAINTENANCE; ENFORCEMNENT 
Each Owner (other than Declarant; provided it will cause all Lots owned by it to be periodically 
mowed) shall keep each Lot owned by such Owner, together with the Adjoining Limited Use 
Common Area and Drainage Reserve Area owned by such Owner in connection with his Lot, if 
applicable, and all improvements therein or thereon in good order, condition and repair, including, 
but not limited to, seeding or sodding grass, watering fertilizing, weed control, mowing of all lawns, 
the pruning and trimming of all trees and shrubbery, removal of diseased or dead trees within a 
reasonable time, weeding of plant beds, the painting, maintenance, repair and replacement, 
(including the painting or other appropriate exterior care) of all Structures, buildings and other 
improvements, roofs, gutters, downspouts, exterior building surfaces and other exterior 
improvements, any enclosed courtyards, decks, exterior doors, windows, glass walls, chimn ey flues, 
and structural items, as well as the patio, patio fence, fence or wall, if any, driveways and sidewalks 
appurtenant to such Lot, all in a manner and with such frequency as is consistent with good property 
management in relation to a quality residential neighborhood such as will exist in the Lots. Each 
Owner of a Lot shall maintain the grass areas within street right-of-ways adjoining such Owner's 
Lot, by watering such area and the regular mowing thereof, to the same condition as such Owner's 
Lot. Specifically, each Owner (other than Declarant) of a Lot with Adjoining Limited Use Common 
Area or appurtenant Drainage Reserve Area shall maintain the Adjoining Limited Use Common 
Area or Drainage Reserve Area, as applicable, in the manner described above (including, but not 
limited to, seeding or sodding grass, watering and mowing such area). However, except as provided 
below, if there is a bank ofa lake or pond within an Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or 
Drainage Reserve Area, the Association, rather than the Owner, shall be responsible for making any 
repairs to such bank which are determined by the Board to be necessary from time-to-time, at the 
Association's expense. Furthermore, if any Lot boundary extends to and includes a lake or pond 
bank, notwithstanding that the bank is within the Lot, then, except as provided below, the 
Association, not the Lot Owner(s), shall have the right and responsibility to make repairs to such 
bank at the expense of the Association when the Board has determined that such repairs are needed. 
The Declarant hereby retains a perpetual nonexclusive easement for itself and the Association, and 
their respective representatives and contractors onto each Lot, Adjoining Limited Use Common 
Area, or Drainage Reserve Area which includes a pond or lake bank for access in order to repair 
such bank from time to time. In any instance when a lake or pond bank requires repair in the 
opinion of the Board, and such repair is necessitated due to the acts of the Owner or his contactor(s), 
including the construction or installation of landscaping or other improvements, then, in lieu of the 
Association repairing such lake or pond bank as provided above, the Owner shall do so promptly at 
his sole cost and expense. Each Owner's obligation hereunder shall commence upon the acquisition 
of such Owner's Lot. 
16 
Ifin the opinion of the DRC, any Owner fails to perform such duties, or otherwise breach such 
Owner's obligations as specified in this Declaration, the Association, upon approval by the Board 
and after fifteen (15) days written notice to such Owner to remedy such default, shall have the right 
(in addition to any other rights and remedies available hereunder or at law or equity) through its 
agents and employees, to enter upon the Lot(s) or Adjoining Limited Use Common Areas and 
Drainage Reserve Area and to seed, sod, water, fertilize, perform weed control, mow, prune, 
remove, repair, maintain, repaint, remove, and restore such Lot, Drainage Reserve Area, or such 
improvements, or otherwise bring such Lot(s), Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or Drainage 
Reserve Area or such improvements into conformity herewith, and the cost thereof (hereinafter 
sometimes called the "Compliance Charge") shall be a binding personal obligation of such Owner 
which may mature into a lien enforceable in the same manner as a mortgage upon the Lot(s) in 
question in the following manner: The Association shall record an Affidavit of Nonpayment of 
Compliance Charge in the Office of the Register of Deeds of Sedgwick County, Kansas, stating (a) 
the legal description of the property upon which the lien is claimed, (b) the name(s) of the Owner(s) 
of said property as last known to the Association, and (c) the amount of the Compliance Charge 
which is unpaid. The lien may be foreclosed in the like manner as a mortgage on real property as 
provided by the laws of Kansas at any time within twenty (20) years following recordation of the 
Affidavit of Nonpayment of Compliance Charge. In any action to foreclose any such lien, the 
Association shall be entitled to recover its costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, and such 
penalties for delinquent charges and assessments as shall have been established by the Association. 
The lien referenced herein shall be created at the time of the filing and recording of the aforesaid 
Affidavit and such lien shall be superior to all other charges, liens, or encumbrances which may 
thereafter in any manner arise or be imposed upon the Lot, whether arising from or imposed by 
judgment or decree or by any agreement, contract, mortgage, or other instrument, saving and 
excepting only such liens for taxes and other public charges as are by applicable law made superior. 
The Compliance Charge shall accrue interest at the rate established from time to time by the Board, 
but in no event less than eighteen percent (18%) per annum or such lesser rate as permitted by law. 
ARTICLE 6-ARCI-IITECTURAL CONTROL: POLICY GUIDELINES: BUILDER APPROVAL. 
Section 6.01. Approval Required. No Strucrure, projection from a Structure, or improvement shall 
be commenced, erected, or maintained upon any Lot, nor shall any exterior addition to or change or 
alteration therein or thereto be made, until the plans and specifications showing the nature, kind, 
shape, height, materials, colors and location of the same shall have been submitted to and approved 
in writing by the design review committee (hereafter the "DRC"), its agents, assignees, or 
successors, as to (a) harmony of external design and location in relation to and effect upon 
surrounding Structures, topography and the overall community design of the Property; (b) the 
character and color of the exterior materials; (c) the quality of the exterior workmanship; and (d) the 
location thereof on the Lot. In the event the DRC fails to approve or disapprove such design and 
location within thirty (30) days after the complete plans and specifications, including a drainage plan 
as required by Section 6.02 hereof, have been submitted to and received by it, approval will not be 
required, and this Article will be deemed to have been fully complied with, After the date the 
Declarant has relinquished its right to designate the members of the DRC under Section 6.07 below, 
the applicant may appeal an adverse decision to the Board, which may reverse or modify such 
decision by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of those directors present and voting at a meeting at which a 
quorum is present. The Board shall establish the schedule for disposition of such appeal upon 
written notice to the Owner taking appeal. The Declarant or DRC may, from time to time, develop 
17 
and promulgate policy guidelines for the application of the design review provisions. The DRC may 
deny approval for any proposed Structure if the Owner is delinquent as to any assessments due 
hereunder. The policy guidelines may include (x) review procedures, (y) aspects and objectives of 
review, and (z) principles and criteria used as standards in determining the achievement of the 
required objectives. The policy guidelines may also include specific design practices that, though 
optional, are generally acceptable methods for achieving the required objectives in particular design 
problems frequently encountered. The policy guidelines are intended to assist the DRC and the 
Owners in the ongoing process of community design. The guidelines may be modified and 
supplemented from time to time by the DRC, subject to the approval of the Board. The initial 
guidelines are contained in Section 6.08 hereof. Additionally, the Declarant or DRC may establish 
other guidelines outside this Declaration from time to time. The provisions of this Section are not 
applicable to any Lots owned by Declarant. 
The laws, rules and regulations of the City of Bel Aire, FEMA and other governmental authorities 
may limit or prohibit the construction or installation of Structures within an Adjoining Limited Use 
Common Area or within a Drainage Reserve Area. Prior to any such construction or installation, the 
Owner(s) of such areas shall investigate and satisfy himself regarding whether or not a proposed 
Structure is permitted by such authorities. 
Section 6.02. Form of Plans and Specifications. Any Owner seeking approval of the DRC shall, at its 
expense, submit plans and specifications in such form and shall contain such information as may be 
required by the DRC, but in any event shall include (a) a site plan of the Lot or Lots showing the 
nature, exterior color scheme, kind, shape, height, materials, and location with respect to the 
particular Lot or Lots (including proposed front, rear, and side set- backs) of all Structures, (b) the 
location thereof with reference to Structures on adjoining portions of the property, (c) and the

Limited Use Common Area or a Drainage Reserve Area, or any new use of a Structure is 
commenced on any Lot, Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or Drainage Reserve Area, 
otherwise than in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the DRC pursuant to 
the provisions of this Article, such alteration, erection, placement, maintenance, or use shall 
be deemed to have been undertaken in violation of this Article and without the approval 
required herein, and, upon written notice from the DRC, any such Structure so altered, 
erected, placed, maintained or used upon any Lot, Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or 
Drainage Reserve Area in violation hereof shall be removed or re-altered, and any such use 
shall be terminated by the Owner(s) of such Lot within a reasonable period of time 
established by the DRC, so as to extinguish such violation. 
B. If fifteen ( 15) days after notice of such a violation, the Owner of the Lot upon which such 
violation exists (or the Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or Drainage Reserve Area on 
which such violation exists) shall not have taken reasonable steps toward the removal or 
termination of the same, and continued the pursuit thereof with diligence, the Association or 
the DRC shall have the right, through their agents and employees, to enter upon such Lot, 
Adjoining Limited Use Common Area and Drainage Reserve Area, if applicable, and to take 
18 
such steps as may be necessary to extinguish such violation, and the cost of such removal 
and alteration shall be a binding, personal obligation of such Owner and, if not paid in full by 
such Owner on demand by the Board, the cost shall mature into a lien upon the Lot(s) in 
question in the following manner: The Association or the DRC shall record an Affidavit of 
Nonpayment of Removal or Alteration Charges in the Office of the Register of Deeds of 
Sedgwick County, Kansas, stating (i) the legal description of the property upon which the

for taxes or other public charges as are by applicable law made superior. The lien may be 
foreclosed in the like marmer as a mortgage on real property as provided by the laws of 
Kansas at any time within twenty (20) years following recordation of an Affidavit of 
Nonpayment of Removal or Alteration Charges. ln any action to foreclose any such lien, the 
Association shall be entitled to recover its costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, and 
such penalties for delinquent charges and assessments as shall have been established by the 
Association. The lien referenced herein shall be created at the time of the filing and 
recording of the affidavit and such lien shall be superior to all other charges, liens, or 
encumbrances which may thereafter in any manner arise or be imposed upon the Lot, 
whether arising from or imposed by judgment or decree or by any agreement, contract, 
mortgage, or other instrument, saving and excepting only such liens for taxes and other 
public charges as are by applicable law made superior. The costs incurred by the Association 
shall accrue interest at the rate established from time to time by the Board, but in no event 
less than eighteen percent (18%) per annum or such lesser rate as permitted by law. 
C. In the event a lien is created pursuant to this Section and thereafter the Affidavit of 
Nonpayment of Removal or Alteration Charges, plus accrued interest and penalties and other 
costs and expenses shall be fully paid, the Association or the DRC shall, within ten ( I 0) days 
following payment, file with the Register of Deeds of Sedgwick County, Kansas, an 
Affidavit of Payment of Removal or Alteration Charges, which affidavit shall (i) refer to and 
identify the Affidavit of Nonpayment of Removal or Alteration Charges which created the 
lien which has been satisfied, (ii) state the legal description of the Lot affected, and (iii) state 
the name(s) of the Owner(s) of the Lot.

extensive review or inspection of the Structure, the plans and specifications, the location of such 
Structure, and the use or uses to be conducted thereon have been approved and that such Structure 
complies therewith. Preparation and recording of such Certificate shall be at the expense of such 
Owner. All costs and expenses incurred by the DRC in evaluating compliance with such plans, 
specifications and other matters and in preparation and recordation of the Certificate of Compliance, 
shall be paid by the requesting party at the time specified by the DRC. Any Certificate of 
Compliance issued in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of 
19 
the facts therein stated, and, as to any purchaser or encumbrance in good faith and for value, or as to 
any title insurer or title examiner, such Certificate of Compliance shall be conclusive evidence that 
all Structures on the Lot, and the use or uses described therein comply with all the requirements of 
this Declaration as to which the DRC exercises any discretionary or interpretive powers. 
Section 6.05. Right of Inspection. A representative of the Board or DRC or any of its agents thereof 
may, at any reasonable time or times, enter upon and inspect any Lot, Adjoining Limited Use 
Common Area or Drainage Reserve Area and any improvements thereon for the purpose of

constructed from such plans and specifications. Neither Declarant, the Association, the DRC, the 
Board, nor the officers, directors, members, employees, and agents of any of them shall be liable in 
damages to anyone submitting plans and specifications to any of them for approval, or to any Owner 
by reason of mistake in judgment, negligence, or nonfeasance arising out of or in connection with

Every person who submits plans or specifications and every Owner agrees that he will not bring any 
action or suit against Declarant, the Association, the DRC, the Board, or the officers, directors, 
members, employees, and agents of any of them to recover any such damages and hereby releases,

in connection with any judgment, negligence, or nonfeasance, and hereby waives the provisions of

approval shall be made in Declarant's sole discretion. Each approved builder shall be required to 
execute a builder's agreement with Declarant on terms satisfactory to Declarant prior to 
commencement of construction. Each Owner is hereby informed tbat, among other things, an 
approved builder is required to pay a marketing fee (the "Marketing Fee") based on the total value of 
the initial residence, garage and related improvements, as provided in such builder's agreement, and 
if such builder fails to pay the same, the Owner of such Lot shall be required to pay the delinquent 
amount. The Marketing Fee shall be paid at the time of substantial completion of such initial

applications under this Article will change from time to time and that opinions on aesthetic maters, 
as well as interpretation and application of the architectural guidelines, may vary accordingly. ln 
addition, each Owner acknowledges that it may not always be possible to identify objectionable 
features of proposed Structure until the Structure is completed, in which case it may be unreasonable 
to require changes to the improvements involved, but the DRC may refuse to approve similar 
proposals in the future. Approval of applications or plans for any Structure, whether completed or 
proposed, or in connection with any other matter requiring approval, shall not be deemed to 
constitute a waiver of the right to withhold approval as to any similar applications, plans, or other 
matters subsequently or additionally submitted for approval. 
Section 6.13. Variances. The DRC may authorize variances from compliance with any of its 
guidelines and procedures when circumstances such as topography, natural obstructions, hardship, or

denying a variance in other circumstances. For purposes of this Section, the inability to obtain 
approval of any governmental agency, the issuance of any permit, or the terms of any financing shall 
not be considered a hardship warranting a variance.

playground equipment in any drainage easement or channel. 
Prior to the commencement of construction of the initial residential improvements and landscaping 
on a Lot, the Owner, or Owner's building contractor, shall hire the subdivision's engineering firm 
(Baughman Company P.A.316-262-7271) at its expense to prepare a Lot Grading Plan for the Lot in 
a manner similar to the Lot Grading Plan attached hereto as Exhibit B. Each Owner shall comply 
with the Lot specific drainage plan which is prepared by such firm. Promptly following the 
completion of construction of the initial residential improvements on such Lot, the Owner, or 
Owner's building contractor, shall hire the same engineering firm to determine the grading of the 
Lot at that time and complete the City of Bel Aire, Kansas, Subdivision Lot Plan Certification form, 
which is also attached hereto as Exhibit B-1. Upon request, the Owner, or Owner's building 
contractor, shall provide a copy thereof to the Association. Each Owner shall provide a copy of the 
Lot Grading Plan and the City of Bel Aire, Kansas, Subdivision Lot Plan Certification pertaining to 
such Owner's Lot to any person installing a lawn, landscaping, fencing or other lawn improvements

have no liability or responsibility to any Owner due to the failure of the builder which constructs the 
residence on the Lot (whether or not such builder is a participant in the Builder's Program for the 
development), adjoining property Owner(s), or the lawn, landscaping or fencing contractor, to 
comply with the aforementioned grading and drainage requirements, or for any resulting effect on 
the Lot, or Owner's improvements, whether or not the appropriate DRC shall have approved any 
plans for such work. 
The DRC or persons designated by the DRC (including the management company engaged by the 
Association) shall have the right to enter upon any Lot upon reasonable advance notice to the Owner 
thereof for the purpose of determining whether the Lot is in compliance with such drainage 
guidelines, standards and plans and the Lot specific grading and drainage plan which each Owner is 
28 
to have prepared by Baughman Company, P.A. as referred to above. A determination by the DRC 
concerning whether or not a Lot is in compliance with such guidelines, standards and plans, shall be 
final and binding on all Owners and; provided, so long as Declarant owns a Lot, the Declarant ( due 
to the unique expertise of its owners, managers, and/or officers) shall have the right to override any 
decision of the Association DRC under this Section 7.28 upon the specific request of any Owner 
and, in the event Declarant so overrides a specific decision of the Association DRC, any subsequent 
reference in this Section 7.28 to the DRC shall refer to the Declarant in lieu of the DRC as to the 
specific decision in question. In the event at any time the DRC determines that a Lot is not in 
compliance with the aforesaid guidelines, standards and plans, the DRC shall give notice to the 
Owner thereof and demand that such corrective action be taken as is necessary to achieve 
compliance. If fifteen (15) days after the notice of such violation, or such additional time as may be 
specified by the DRC, the Owner of such Lot has not taken reasonable steps to correct the same, the 
Board on behalf of the Association DRC shall have the right, through its agents and contractors, to 
enter the Lot and to take such steps that may be necessary to bring the same into compliance. The 
Owner of the Lot so corrected shall reimburse the Association for the costs of such compliance and 
pay the Association a fee equal to twenty percent (20%) of such amount. In the event such Owner 
fails to pay such reimbursement in full within ten (I 0) days following demand thereof, the Board 
may thereafter establish a special assessment applicable to such Owner and his Lot for the costs 
thereof and enforce the same as provided in Article TV hereof. It is not the Declarant's responsibility 
or obligation to enforce compliance with the master drainage and grading plans. The DRC and the 
Declarant shall have no liability or responsibility to any builder, Owner or other party for the failure 
of a builder or Owner to final grade or maintain any Lot in accordance with the master drainage and 
grading plan or any approved lot drainage and grading plan or for the DRC or the Declarant not 
requiring a lot drainage and grading plan or compliance therewith or for the quality or compaction of 
any soil. The rights of the DRC, the Board and the Association hereunder are cumulative and in 
addition to any rights and remedies otherwise available at law or equity.

that erosion and sediment control measures be implemented in connection with construction 
activities on a Lot, Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or Drainage Reserve Area, including, but 
not limited to, site work such as clearing, excavating, and grading the Lot, Adjoining Limited Use 
Common Area or Drainage Reserve Area, in order to eliminate or substantially reduce storm water 
discharge, the discharge of pollutants and water quality violations. Significant penalties may be 
imposed in the event activities are not conducted in full compliance with the aforementioned permit, 
laws, regulations and ordinances. Each Owner agrees to conduct activities including construction 
activities, on his Lot, Adjoining Limited Use Common Area and appurtenant Drainage Reserve 
Area, if applicable, strictly in accordance with this Declaration, all laws, rules, regulations, and 
ordinances now or hereafter in effect, including, but not limited to those referenced above, and shall 
indemnify and defend Declarant and the Association from any consequences of such Owner's, or his 
contractors' or subcontractors', failure to so comply, including but not limited to all damages, 
liabilities, fines, penalties and costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses). 
Section 7.37. Construction Work. Except in an emergency, or when other unusual circumstances

Section 7.39. Water Encroachment; Flood Insurance. Notice is hereby given to anyone acquiring a 
Lot, or having use of an Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or a Drainage Reserve Area, that due 
to the grading and drainage of such Lot (which is necessary to enhance the views from residences, 
particularly those with "walk-out" or "view-out" basements) and Adjoining Limited Use Common 
30 
Area and Drainage Reserve Area, at times following considerable amounts of rainfall, water may 
encroach into the yard areas within the Drainage Reserve Area and such Lot. Water may 
accumulate in areas of the Lot, the Adjoining Limited Use Common Area and the Drainage Reserve 
Area, if applicable, which has been graded at lower elevations to provide drainage. If the Lot or 
appurtenant Drainage Reserve Area is adjacent to a lake, pond, stream or other waterway, water 
from such areas may spill over into the Lot as a result of such rainfall. Since the Adjoining Limited 
Use Common Area adjoins a lake, pond, stream or other waterway, water from such areas will 
extend onto the Adjoining Limited Use Common Area and the Lots adjacent thereto. Depending 
upon how much water accumulates within such areas and how long it remains, damage could occur 
to the residence, yard trees, vegetation, fences, gazebos, patios, playground equipment or other 
improvements or installations of Structures. Neither Declarant nor the Association shall have any 
liability or responsibility for any such damage resulting from such water encroachment. 
Section 7.40. Water Levels in Lakes and Ponds. There is no assurance that lakes, ponds and other 
bodies of water within the Property, if any, shall continue in the future to contain water levels 
consistent with the levels existing on the date hereof and, in fact, such lakes, ponds and bodies of 
water may at some point in the future become dry or substantially empty of any water. Neither 
Declarant, the Association, the Board nor any member officer or employee of Declarant or the 
Association shall have any liability or responsibility to Owners for any change in the water levels in 
any such lakes, ponds, or bodies of water, including if such bodies of water become dry or 
substantially empty of water. 
Section 7.41. Mowing Assessment. In addition to the general assessments hereunder, any unimproved 
Lot shall be assessed One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for each calendar month during the mowing 
season between the date the same is acquired by an Owner ( other than the Declarant) and the 
commencement of construction of a residence thereon, in order to reimburse the Declarant or the 
Association for the cost of periodically mowing such Lot so that it remains in a slightly condition; 
provided, such cost may be reasonably increased or decreased from time to time by Declarant or the 
Association based on the actual mowing costs. An easement is hereby established to permit the 
Declarant, the Association and contractors of either to enter upon a Lot for mowing prior to the 
commencement of construction of a residence thereon. 
Section 7.42. Maintenance of Drainage Channels and Swales. Each Owner shall maintain, mow, and 
keep in good repair and condition, in accordance with the master drainage plan, all drainage 
channels and swales located on any Lot owned by such Owner and Adjoining Limited Use Common 
Area and Drainage Reserve Area, if applicable. In the event storm drains are installed within any 
Lot, Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or Drainage Reserve Area, the Owner thereof shall 
maintain the drain inlets in an unobstructed manner. Any drainage channels and swales at the 
roadside shall be grass, unless other vegetation or material is approved by the DRC. 
Section 7.43. Odors; Burning. No activity (other than reasonable and customary construction 
activity) which emits foul or obnoxious odors, fumes, dust, smoke, or pollution outside the Lot, 
Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or Drainage Reserve Area, or which creates noise, 
unreasonable risk of fire or explosion, or other conditions which are a nuisance shall not be 
conducted within a Lot, Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or Drainage Reserve Area. No 
outside burning of trash, leaves, debris or other materials shall be permitted on a Lot, Adjoining 
Limited Use Common Area or Drainage Reserve Area. 
31 
Section 7.44. Clippings; Debris. Dumping grass clippings, leaves or other debris, petroleum 
products, fertilizers. or other potentially hazardous or toxic substances in any storm sewer, drainage 
ditch, and any other component of the storm drainage system serving the Property, or any stream, 
pond, or lake, or elsewhere within the Property is prohibited. 
Section 7.45. Safety and Security. Each Owner and occupant of a Lot, and the respective guests and 
invitees thereof, shall be responsible for their own personal safety and the security of their property 
in the subdivision within the Property. The Association may, but shall not be obligated to, maintain 
or support certain activities in the subdivision within the Property designed to enhance the level of 
safety or security which each person provides for himself and his property. Neither the Association 
nor Declarant shall in any way be considered insurers or guarantors of security within the 
subdivision within the Property, nor shall either be held liable for any loss or damage by reason of 
failure to provide adequate security or ineffectiveness of security measures undertaken. No 
representation or warranty is made that any systems or measures cannot be compromised or 
circumvented, nor that any such systems or security measures undertaken will in all cases prevent 
loss or provide the detection or protection for which the system is designed or intended. Each 
Owner acknowledges, understands and shall be responsible for informing all occupants of a Lot that 
the Association, its Board and committees, and Declarant are not guarantors of security or safety and 
that each person or entity using the subdivision in the Property assumes all risks of personal injury 
and loss or damage to property, including Lots and the contents of Lots improvements thereon, 
resulting from acts of third parties. 
Section 7.46. Responsibility for Repair and Replacement. Each Owner further covenants and agrees 
that in the event of damage to or destruction of Structures on his Lot, Adjoining Limited Use 
Common Area or appurtenant Drainage Reserve Area, if applicable, the Owner shall proceed 
promptly to repair or to reconstruct in a manner consistent with the original construction or such 
other plans and specifications as are approved in accordance with Article 6. Alternately, the Owner 
shall clear the Lot, Adjoining Limited Use Common Area or appurtenant Drainage Reserve Area, if 
applicable, and maintain it in a neat and attractive landscaped condition consistent with the 
requirements of this Declaration. The Owner shall pay any costs which are not covered by insurance 
proceeds. 
Section 7.47. Possibility of Abandoned Wells. In the past, oil and gas wells were drilled in the area of 
the Property. It is possible wells were drilled and abandoned within the Property and each Owner 
shall investigate such possibility to the extent it deems appropriate and Declarant shall have no 
liability or responsibility therefor. 
Section 7.48. Water for Irrigation. Declarant may drill a well or wells for water to irrigate the 
Common Area. If Declarant is unsuccessful in obtaining appropriate permits or authorizations for 
such well(s); is unable to complete a satisfactory well or wells; or a well or wells ceases to produce 
sufficient water volumes, then water from a city or other body or district may be used for such 
irrigation, at a higher cost. 
Section 7.49. Storage Pods and Other Facilities. Except as otherwise permitted from time to time by 
the Board, temporary storage pods, containers or other similar storage facilities shall not be located 
in the open on a Lot, except on a temporary basis. A "temporary basis" as used in the proceeding 
sentence shall mean (a) usage by the building contractors during the initial construction of the 
residence, and (b) following the completion of the initial residence, then only by the Owner(s) in 
32 
connection with their move into the residence or a move out of the residence for a period not to 
exceed thirty (30) consecutive days in connection with each move in or move out. Whether to allow 
exceptions to the prohibition contained in this Section is in the discretion of the Board, but Declarant 
recognizes that in times of substantial remodeling of a residence, and possibly other circumstances, 
it would be appropriate for the Board to allow such items to be stored in the open for a short time.
