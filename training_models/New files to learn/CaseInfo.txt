The pictures from your surgery are included in this email for you to see. I have labeled them for your convince. Typically, your physical therapist will often want to see your pictures to have a better understanding of your surgery. They will also need your physical therapy prescription before they can start treatment. Your therapy prescription is located in the packet of paperwork that was sent home with you from the surgery center.There are also great handouts about post operative instructions that have answers to most of your questions, so be sure to fully read those. If the answer is not there, feel free to call us for help.I hope you have a pleasant and speedy recovery.Dr. Daniel ProhaskaThis email is not checked for response.
